To install the library, you have to do it manually

first: 

make 

it will create 3 files in lib directory, they are the soname files and links . libquantumlibrary.so.x.y should be copied in /usr/local/lib
x = version number
y = minor number

then execute (as root):

ln -sf libquantumlibrary.so.x.y /usr/local/lib/libquantumlibrary.so.x
ln -sf libquantumlibrary.so.x /usr/local/lib/libquantumlibrary.so

/usr/bin/local should be in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or be by another mean in the search path of ld
(I need documentation nd explaination about it)

and thats it !

I need comment about it because I want the process of installation to be automatic

The makefile shoud be modified

Sorry for the incovenience !
